## Entry points

Run a single solve:
    python -m solver.run <dsl_file> [workspace] [--scramble SCRAMBLE]

Generate data:
    python -m generation.data_generation [workspace]

Both default to `workspace/stable` if no workspace argument is provided.

## Workspace

`workspace/stable/` holds your curated DSL files, algorithm caches, and
generated data. Never cleared automatically.

`workspace/scratch/` is used by the discovery loop for thousands of generated
DSLs and their data. Safe to delete entirely between discovery runs.


## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get the project running locally.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd cube_solver
```

### 2. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```


### 3. Install dependencies

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Install the project (editable mode)

This allows you to run modules cleanly using `python -m ...`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 5. Verify solver binary

Ensure the correct solver binary exists for your platform:

```
bin/
├── linux/kube_solver
├── mac/kube_solver
└── windows/kube_solver.exe
```

The code will automatically select the correct one using `platform.system()`.

If a binary is missing for your platform, build it from
[kubesolver](https://github.com/kuba97531/kubesolver):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuba97531/kubesolver.git /tmp/kubesolver
cd /tmp/kubesolver
make BUILD=RELEASE -j5            # Linux
make BUILD=RELEASE CC=gcc-15 -j5  # macOS — needs Homebrew gcc for OpenMP
```

Then copy `kube_solver.out` into the matching `bin/<platform>/kube_solver`
(rename, drop the extension, `chmod +x`). On macOS the trailing `strip -s`
step in the upstream makefile fails harmlessly — the binary is already linked
by then.

### 6. Run a smoke test

From the project root:

```bash
python -m solver.run workspace/stable/dsl/zz_method.dsl
```

If everything is set up correctly, this should execute a solve and print the result.

To run against a specific scramble:

```bash
python -m solver.run workspace/stable/dsl/zz_method.dsl --scramble "R U R' U'"
```


### 7. (Optional) Run tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Notes

* Always run commands from the **project root**, not inside `src/`
* The project uses a **workspace system**:

  * `workspace/stable/` → persistent, curated methods and data
  * `workspace/scratch/` → temporary discovery output
* Editable install (`pip install -e .`) ensures `src/` is correctly added to Python’s module path
